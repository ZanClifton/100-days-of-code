# 100 Days Of Code Log

There is a version of this log on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/my-100-days-of-code-1?v=1) where you can fork the project to create your own, publicly readable, log.

Instructions for creating your own log to run locally can be found [here](https://github.com/ZanClifton/100-days-of-code/tree/main/log).

### Day 1: Oct 8, Saturday

**Activity:** Refactored the 100 Days Log for my own specific instance of 100 Days of Code

**Thoughts:** This was a fun project. Most of the logic was already written, but I had to think about how I would implement a repl without certain functions so that it can be publicly read but not written to. It was more challenging than I expected to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL, but only because I've only done it a couple of times before. Debugging through the things that I'd missed was pleasantly easy, and I think I'm improving a lot in terms of reading error messages and understanding them. It definitely took longer to carry out all the admin related tasks of setting up the repo and repl than it did to write the code. Nevertheless, a good start!
