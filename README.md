# 100 Days Of Code Log

There is a version of this log on [Replit](https://replit.com/@ZanClifton/my-100-days-of-code-1?v=1) where you can fork the project to create your own, publicly readable, log.

Instructions for creating your own log to run locally can be found [here](https://github.com/ZanClifton/100-days-of-code/tree/main/log).

| Refactored the 100 Days Log for my own specific instance of 100 Days of Code | This was a fun project. Most of the logic was already written, but I had to think about how I would implement a repl without certain functions so that it can be publicly read but not written to. It was more challenging than I expected to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL, but only because I've only done it a couple of times before. Debugging through the things that I'd missed was pleasantly easy, and I think I'm improving a lot in terms of reading error messages and understanding them. All-in-all, a good start! |
