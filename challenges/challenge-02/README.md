# 100 Days of Code x2

### Day 1: Jan 22 2023, Sunday

**Activity:** Snek

**Thoughts:** Guided by 100 Days of Python, here is my version of 'Snake'. I'm getting better at Python classes, but still feel confused at times. This uses the in built Turtle module to display the game graphics. The limitations of using this module are exposed at slower speeds as it takes so long to 'draw' the snake and to respond to the keyboard commands as a result.

### Day 2: Jan 23 2023, Monday

**Activity:** Pong

**Thoughts:** Created a screen, two paddles, and a ball for Pong. At the moment, you can't press and hold the paddle keys, expecting movement to continue, as the second key press interrupts the first. Although that might not matter so much as you'll only really move your paddle when you know where the ball is travelling towards you, probably.

### Day 3: Jan 24 2023, Tuesday

**Activity:** Pong

**Thoughts:** Not time for much this morning. Added the bounce method to the Ball class to get it to change direction when it strikes the top or bottom of the screen. Sadly that's probably it for the day, but something is better than nothing, I guess.
