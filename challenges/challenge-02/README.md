# 100 Days of Code x2

### Day 1: Jan 22 2023, Saturday

**Activity:** Snek

**Thoughts:** Guided by 100 Days of Python, here is my version of 'Snake'. I'm getting better at Python classes, but still feel confused at times. This uses the in built Turtle module to display the game graphics. The limitations of using this module are exposed at slower speeds as it takes so long to 'draw' the snake and to respond to the keyboard commands as a result.
