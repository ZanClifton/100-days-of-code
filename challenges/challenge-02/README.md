# 100 Days of Code x2

### Day 1: Jan 22 2023, Sunday

**Activity:** Snek

**Thoughts:** Guided by 100 Days of Python, here is my version of 'Snake'. I'm getting better at Python classes, but still feel confused at times. This uses the in built Turtle module to display the game graphics. The limitations of using this module are exposed at slower speeds as it takes so long to 'draw' the snake and to respond to the keyboard commands as a result.

### Day 2: Jan 23 2023, Monday

**Activity:** Pong

**Thoughts:** Created a screen, two paddles, and a ball for Pong. At the moment, you can't press and hold the paddle keys, expecting movement to continue, as the second key press interrupts the first. Although that might not matter so much as you'll only really move your paddle when you know where the ball is travelling towards you, probably.

### Day 3: Jan 24 2023, Tuesday

**Activity:** Pong

**Thoughts:** Not time for much this morning. Added the bounce method to the Ball class to get it to change direction when it strikes the top or bottom of the screen. Sadly that's probably it for the day, but something is better than nothing, I guess.

### Day 4: Jan 25 2023, Wednesday

**Activity:** Pong

**Thoughts:** I finished up the game but am a little disappointed about some of the functionality. Holding a move key down for a paddle seems to prevent the other player from moving their own paddle, as can queuing up a whole bunch of key presses (I think this is to do with the `time.sleep` command for refreshing the screen and is therefore a quirk of the way it combines with the Turtle module). Happy it's done, though, and it's even kind of fun playing yourself.

### Day 5: Jan 28 2023, Saturday

**Activity:** Turtle Crossing

**Thoughts:** Put together 'Turtle Crossing', an absolute knock off of Crossy Road made with Python and the Turtle module and of course the graphics are atrocious. It's also buggy as hell in Replit, which is super annoying. I've always found Replit to be pretty reliable till now but it's not always resetting the turtle to the bottom of the screen. Not happy about it. Although a thought has just occurred to me! It might be to do with holding down the up arrow key meaning the turtle skips across the reset point. I'll make a note and refactor it sometime this week coming.
