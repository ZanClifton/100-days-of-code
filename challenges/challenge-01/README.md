# 100 Days of Code x1

## 48 Days of Code, Really

My first attempt at 100 Days of Code was interrupted by sickness, holiday, and then things getting hectic at work. I made it to 48 days and then lost track of what work I'd done as I began filling in the log sporadically.

[Attempt #2](https://github.com/ZanClifton/100-days-of-code/tree/main/challenges/challenge-02) is a go!

### Day 48: Sep 18, Sunday

<img src="https://github.com/ZanClifton/basic-python-projects/blob/main/images/multi-user-movie-watch-list.png" width=250px align=left alt="Multi-User Movie Watch List"/>

**Today's Progress:** Created a link table for users/movies and adjusted the code to allow for it.

**Thoughts:** The SQL stuff is nice to refresh on. I haven't really thought too much about SQL since finishing the boot camp and I forgot how much I really love it. I've also really appreciated using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). It makes a big difference being able to see the data in such a handy and visual way. You can also run queries with it to check you're getting the right results.

**Today's Progress:** Editing the Movie Watch List to account for multiple users.

**Thoughts:** Bit short of time today so I've laid the ground work for multiple users by adding a watcher table. I keep forgetting we have a bank holiday on Monday so I have an extra opportunity to do some more stuff this week coming. I might see if [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) is free. Could really do with a catchup about how it's going at her new job, and it might be nice to do something lighthearted together.

### Day 46: Sep 16, Friday

**Today's Progress:** I made a movie watch list in Python using the SQLite module. I also learned how far in advance some movie franchise release dates are planned!

**Thoughts:** I consolidated my understanding of making SQL queries through Python. Some things flummoxed me for a while, such as converting the timestamp back to human readable dates, but I read through some documentation and got there (and that's a lack of Python knowledge, not SQL). A cursor is needed when you request data from the table, not when inserting or updating data. Think I'm getting it.

### Day 45: Sep 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Added the SQLite stuff. Tried to get my head around cursors. Not sure it worked, but after a fair bit of fiddling, the database does!

**Thoughts:** And I love SQL! So much! I need to do more projects for this combination of delicious things. There are more things I want to add to this, but I'm happy with where it's at.

#

### Day 44: Sep 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Started working on writing a 100 Days Log in Python.

**Thoughts:** I haven't connected up the inbuilt SQLite module but that's what I intend to use for the database. There is nothing I dislike about Python. It just seems so delightfully packaged and self-contained. The syntax is beautiful and easily comprehended. Can you be in love with a programming language and its attendant... things? Didn't get enough time to work on this today as I really wanted to get to the SQL, but it works as long as you don't want persistent data.

#

### Day 43: Sep 9, Friday

**Today's Progress:** [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I killed the repo we were using before because it just wouldn't link up properly. We've created a new repo from scratch with a much simpler approach and kicked TypeScript to the curb for now as we can't seem to find a consensus on how it's all supposed to be set up.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96394256/189399022-243e6f8e-da96-4fea-873e-eb2d50f424d8.png" width=360px align=right alt="Queen Elizabeth tribute, Jisc website"/>

**Thoughts:** Once we got it working in JS it was a lot of fun! It involved a hideous amount of maths, though. Could have done without that. Getting the first set of balls to circle was pleasantly achievable, but the bouncing balls took ages and ages, partly because we didn't understand how the coordinates worked at first. It's one of those projects where the learning comes from what you get wrong and fail to achieve rather than what you succeed at. I was going to help Leigh prepare for the Northcoders Entry Challenge but because The Queen died yesterday, he was involved in creating a banner for the website at work.

#

### Day 42: Sep 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I had another look at getting pixi.js set up. We didn't quite get everything set in TypeScript but we have got everything connected up, now. I also finished up a couple of basic Python projects. Creating an Etch-A-Sketch was kind of a warmup task in preparation for creating the Turtle Race, but I enjoyed both so much and was sufficiently pleased with them that I added them both to my project repo.

**Thoughts:** Diana is starting work at a new company on Monday and this means she'll be in the office 3 days a week. This will probably curtail our Smack Apps opportunities, and I'm a little disappointed by that as, not only do I really enjoy Diana's company each morning, but I've found doing this bit of coding together gets me in the right mindset for a great day at work! However, I'm super glad she's going to work at a really great company and I can't wait to hear all about it!

### Day 41: Sep 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I are starting to work on using TypeScript and pixi.js to draw some 3D animations.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't get our files talking to each other so haven't managed to get it to work yet. We'll work on it again tomorrow!

### Day 40: Sep 6, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Created an app using Python Turtle that creates dot paintings, Damien Hirst style. Probably not worth the same amount of money, though, however much I try to convince people otherwise.

**Thoughts:** This was pure fun! Figuring out how to use the Turtle to draw was actually pretty cool! I enjoyed all the warm up exercises and really felt like I'd learned loads!

### Day 38: Aug 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** [Dane](https://github.com/danewhitfield), [Zack](https://github.com/schaxmann) and I took part in a mini-hack this evening. The task was to create a negotiation tool for use between a race track and the jockeys who ride on it, where the jockeys are dissatisfied with the current conditions. We were representing the race track. The idea we had for the tool was that it would offer a number of different options for a fixed number of rounds of negotiation, after which it would only make a lowball offer that wouldn't change until the jockeys accepted it. We didn't quite get it finished but I was really happy with what we achieved in 2 hours.

**Thoughts:** This was useful on a number of levels. I'm not great at estimating what's achievable in a certain time scale, so the more opportunities I get to practice this, the better. We were really very close with this estimation and it was only the time pressure at the very end that prevented us from figuring out the last bit of logic we needed. We also got to chat with experienced industry professionals afterward. That was really fun and enlightening, and I even got [tweeted about by David McCarter](https://twitter.com/realDotNetDave/status/1557130619620012034)! He didn't add me back on LinkedIn, though...

### Day 37: Aug 5, Friday

**Today's Progress:** [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I added some routes today. This adds the username and chat room to the URL. We've intentionally not used these search queries to set the room and username, though, because we don't want to bypass the welcome page. We then added a toast to pop up when you press the join room button but haven't input a room and username.

**Thoughts:** This was fun. We had a lot of discussion about a number of ideas for implementation and we spent ages on deciding how we wanted to use the toast. We also discussed some ideas for later on, such as making chats 'saveable' to a file or maybe even keeping it in local storage.

### Day 36: August 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** It was a long day at work and I'm feeling a bit stupid because I can't work out what I need to do to make something work. That was a lot of 'work', that sentence. Anyway, for some fun, I started _working_ on my oop text adventure: Game With No Graphics. Catchy, I know.

**Thoughts:** I'm not 100% sure I'm setting things up right for my class-based adventure. I think my confidence has taken a bit of a knock today because of how difficult I found things at work. It's so much harder poking around in an established project than it is just mashing things together in one of my own. Sprint ends tomorrow so I'll need to admit defeat and get some help. In the meantime, I have plans to work on [Smack Chat](https://github.com/smack-apps/smack-chat) tomorrow before work and some TypeScript on Friday morning.

### Day 35.3: August 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** 
| **To Do** | **Done** |
|:----------|:--------:|
| Host App | ❌

**Thoughts:** Well, if I can manage to set npm on the remote server so that I can actually install all the packages for the app then I'll be getting somewhere. My googlefu may be getting stronger but my ability to make this work doesn't seem to be. Perhaps you get what you pay for and I should go back to the AWS tutorial labyrinth. If I have the chance tonight, I'm going to spend some time making a little OOP text adventure in Python, a bit more complicated than the last one, and hopefully more interactive.

### Day 35.2: August 1, Monday

**Today's Progress:**

| Host App | ❌


**Thoughts:** Okay, I feel like I'm getting close. After looking around for services with less complicated access requirements, I found a cheap service I think I can use to have a remote server for about £1 a month, so I'm going to give that a try.

### Day 35.1: July 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

|:----------|:--------:|
| Host App | ❌


**Thoughts:** Why can't I figure this out? I feel like I'm lost in a maze of AWS tutorials and before I can get anywhere there's another hoop that needs to be leapt through. Learning loads about remote servers, but still haven't got a working solution.

### Day 35: July 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** 
| **To Do** | **Done** |
|:----------|:--------:|
| Org Read Me | ✔️
| App Read Me | ✔️
| Merge Pull Request | ✔️
| Host App | ❌
| Coffee Machine | ✔️

**Thoughts:** So, I shouldn't really complain, but I decided I wanted to try hosting with AWS and having created my IAM account, I need to wait 24 hours before I can access everything. This means I can't do the hosting for the app today, so I've instead spent a few hours writing an OOP version of the coffee machine I made last week. It's strange that I have a bit of a mental block on accessing properties in Python. I had a bit of a block with the same thing in JavaScript at first, too. Repetition, repetition, repetition. That's what I always say. It's probably annoying. On another note, I have decided I'm not a fan of PyCharm. I'll give it a few more projects and see if I can get comfortable with it. It's just doing so much that I don't fully understand yet, rather like Android Studio, and I'm suspicious of exactly what that is.

### Day 34: July 29, Friday

**Today's Progress:** [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I refactored quite a bit of the react chat code today, styled the app, got messages rendering, designed a logo, created an organisation on GitHub and transferred the repo to it, and finished the main functionality (not necessarily in that order).

**Thoughts:** Around about lunch time we realised we were completely stuck on why the recipient of the message was getting two copies, but the sender only got one. Once again, the solution came down to Diana's patience and amazing ability to get to the bottom of a problem; it was Strict Mode. We removed it where it wrapped the app and suddenly it was working properly! It's in a 'showable' state, now. Jobs for tomorrow include getting it hosted, writing a decent read me for the app and for the organisation repo, and merging in the 3rd pull request (again, not necessarily in that order).

### Day 33: July 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** It's now possible to enter a chat room, and you can also see messages in the console.

**Thoughts:** I'm not entirely sure why [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I wanted to make it so that you entered a chat room, but it does leave a lot of scope for adding extra features, such as a room menu, validation on room IDs, etc. I love it as a project is coming together and you see it taking shape; it feels like there's endless possibility with it at the moment.

### Day 32: July 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Okay, [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I are abandoning our simple chat now to create our React chat app instead. We've taken our simple chat server code to start us off and put it together with the React app frontend.

**Thoughts:** Oddly, it feels significantly more challenging to put this together with React. Nevertheless, we've got our servers talking to each other and that's all we need today.

### Day 31: July 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Started the app [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I planned out. It's a basic html chat app using [socket.io](https://socket.io/). We just want to understand how it works, then we're going to create another app with React at the frontend.

**Thoughts:** So, this isn't our first try at socket.io. We tried this on the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) coding bootcamp and it didn't work well for us. This time, Diana has done a really deep dive into understanding exactly what websockets and socket.io actually do, and this has made all the difference; it's actually making sense and the app is actually working!

### Day 30: July 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first draft of Coffee Machine Simulator.

**Thoughts:** Yeah, having kids around while coding is definitely doing it on hard mode. Functions were out the window today. You can actually see where day one ended and day two began by the abandonment of functions. Probably needs a refactor tomorrow.

### Day 29: July 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Finished Higher/Lower! Started working on a Coffee Machine Simulator in Python. Only has 3 things on the menu. None of them are real, anyway.

### Day 28: July 22, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started working on Higher/Lower, a python console game guessing which of two options has the greater number of Instagram followers. This is the last app in the beginner section of the 100 Days of Python course and it's more challenging thinking my way around the problem than I expected.

**Thoughts:** I think I need to work on app planning more. When it comes to a sequence of events I'm never entirely sure I'm approaching it correctly. I end up working through everything chronologically and I strongly suspect that's not actually the best approach. Unrelated, I'm contributing to my GitHub a bit more frequently again and that feels positive.

### Day 27: July 18, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Made a little number guessing game I decided to call 'Not-[Numberwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY_zcHjARgc)'. Also fixed a little bug that had crept into Blackjack when I refactored it.

**Thoughts:** I really have enjoyed the beginner section of the 100 Days of Python course. The last two lessons in this section are on debugging and then another game before we move away from Replit and onto PyCharm. I nearly skipped this whole section because it covered basics I really thought I didn't need, but it's definitely been worth doing it. Although I was confident about a lot of the concepts from learning JS, there were ideas I'd not fully grasped and differences in the way Python and JS work, so all-in-all it's been a good experience.

#
### Day 26: July 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I refactored the blackjack function so that it was significantly less obnoxious. Well, in all honesty, I actually rewrote that specific function from scratch.

**Thoughts:** Wow, that was shockingly simple once I cleared out the clutter! Because I'd already produced the other functions, I didn't really need to think about anything other than the flow of the game. This strikes me as a really good practice. Weirdly, [Jason](https://github.com/JasonClifton) suggested deleting the whole thing and rewriting it yesterday for practice, but after the time I spent on it, I wasn't keen. Seems he was right (but don't tell him; he'll be unbearable).

#
### Day 25: July 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I wrote a Blackjack game in Python.

**Thoughts:** I'm still *really* overcomplicating things. While I think the code is moderately readable, I could have saved myself a lot of hassle by not using quite so many if statements. Those if statements led to me agonising over what went where within which function. Interestingly, the feedback I got from my Northcoders entry challenge was that I used if statements where I didn't need to. I'm going to leave what I've made today, and tomorrow, I'm going to refactor the app and see if I can simplify it, now that I've looked at the hints.

### Day 24: July 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** I made a recursive function calculator app in Python. It uses a while loop and calls itself when you want to start a completely fresh calculation. It only performs 4 operations but there's nothing stopping me increasing the complexity later.

**Thoughts:** I have finally made peace with the fact that my first 100 Days of Code experience is being accomplished with flagrant disregard for the rules! I can't anticipate my availability, energy levels or motivation on any given day, right now, above and beyond my existing responsibilities and settling in to my new job. I love coding and want to learn all the things immediately, but that's not practical and I need to pace myself sensibly, or run the risk of seeing it as a chore, not a delight.

### Day 23: July 06, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Made a little console app in Python, this evening, that tells you how many days in the month for any year you choose in CE.

**Thoughts:** I love Python! There's something so enjoyable about working with it. I'm keeping projects small in the hopes of being able to do a little each day. I'm still not quite being as consistent as I should be.

**Today's Progress:** Before work, [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I got together to solve a kata.

**Thoughts:** We solved this using array methods. I'm sure this isn't the most efficient way to do this but until I understand computer science more, I've no idea how it could be better.

### Day 21: July 02, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Using Python, I made a blind auction program that runs in the console.

**Thoughts:** I'd like to claim I spent the last week playing Universal Paperclips with [my amazing autoclicker](https://github.com/ZanClifton/python-autoclicker) but it's not the case, I'm afraid! I started in a new job and it's kind of consumed all my learning capacity. I'm aiming to go back to doing at least one little simple project after work this week coming, but we'll see how it goes. As for my blind auction program, it's very simple, but with some judicious googling I found my way through it using the max() function.

#
### Day 20: June 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I made an autoclicker in Python.

**Thoughts:** I've been very unwell for the last few weeks and this has completely scuppered my 100 Days of Code progress, along with my learning overall. I'm about back on track, now, I think, just in time to start a new job on Monday. I'm disappointed that I haven't had more time to learn more things before starting, but I have a feeling I'll have a sharp learning curve ahead of me anyway.

For my project today, I tried out GitHub Copilot, and honestly, I'm not a good enough coder to use a tool like that right now. It was immensely helpful in putting the project together, but it did too much of the heavy lifting for me and I think it probably stunted a few opportunities to stretch myself.

I am delighted, however, to have finished the autoclicker (and made good use of it playing [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html))!

### Day 19: June 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** The hackathon finished before we were finished but the app is okay as proof of concept.

**Thoughts:** The lack of sleep really took its toll on us. The project is extraordinarily front end heavy and our two most inexperienced coders (including me) are the ones working on it. Fortunately, [Jason](https://github.com/JasonClifton) is extremely experienced and to give us a hand on the front, just quickly learned a bit of JS to help us out. One day, I hope I'm able to do something like that. That was really, very cool.

### Day 18: June 11, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Taking part in the ShowCode Athena Hackathon 2022. My team are putting together an app to help displaced people or refugees to connect with others near them who have pets, and enable them to spend time with those pets and their families. Front end is JS with React and the back end is C# and SQL.

**Thoughts:** Really good to revisit React (betcha no one ever expected me to say that) and reflect on how much easier it is to follow around what's happening in each component. Absolutely never thought I'd get to this stage and I'm genuinely delighted to be able to see actual, proper progress! We've chucked a little bit of Bootstrap in for styling and I still can't decide if that's a good idea or not.

### Day 17: June 6, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Having a flutter with Flutter today. I was making an app based on the original [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) app. I'm not quite finished but I think I'm pretty close.

**Thoughts:** There's a job I was considering applying for which would make extensive use of Flutter. Turns out it's not a remote role and I probably won't be applying for it, but before I realised that, I was partway through a project. The initial bits of Flutter felt really intuitive, and I think it's because it reminds me a little of React (and there's a sentence I never imagined I'd utter). In a sense, widgets are basically just components, but (certainly at the stage I'm using it at) the tree seems more obvious than React components did at first. Regardless, I immediately felt a little bit like I'd come home after travelling a while, only to find that everyone got stuff organised while I was gone, and now I can see where everything is and how it fits together. It was exciting to experience! However, the set up to get everything working took much longer than I expected and I coded less than I wanted.

### Day 16: June 5, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Today, [Gareth](https://github.com/gwdawson) and I worked together on a program to access a CSV file and use the data contained in it. We had a list of exits and entries to a car park. We filtered out bikes, calculated the average length of time spent there by each car, and appended a list of cars that have used the car park and how many times.

**Thoughts:** This was surprisingly challenging, and I think our thought processes actually show in the (somewhat untidy) approach we've taken. We spent about 4 hours on it, but I'd say it felt like 20. Every time we thought we'd understood the problem, we hit another snag. It was very useful working through it step by step, as we were able to identify issues with our code and fix them as they went. Identifying each issue showed us how poorly we grasped the task initially. It will need a revisit and refactor at some point.

### Day 15: June 4, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Made 'map' and 'filter' functions in Python that take a preset list of numbers and perform a specified operation on them. 

**Thoughts:** I think it's really useful taking higher order functions and trying to replicate them yourself. I found this useful in JavaScript, too. Understanding what's happening behind the scenes when you call them is really valuable. 

I've got a whole bunch of lessons for the CodeVerse Python Bootcamp I haven't yet completed. I'm making my way through them as quick as I can before Monday. I had a bit of trouble using the platform in Chromium so I've switched to Firefox and it's going a bit smoother now. Hopefully I can get them all finished today.

### Day 14: June 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Maximal() site! Of course, I only discovered that Google Domains don't offer domain masking when I tried to set it up, so tomorrow may involve a little investigation of how I can sort that.  

**Thoughts:** Completely forgot it was the Jubilee today until I saw all the neighbours bringing tables and chairs outside into the street and firing up the barbecue. Absolutely gorgeous day with lovely weather! Do I regret spending most of it inside coding? Well, I'm a curmudgeonly sort and have no regrets whatsoever. [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) introduced me to some amazing things I'd never tried (like handling the data for the bios like [this](https://github.com/ZanClifton/maximal-murdle-project-page/blob/main/max-murdle/src/data/data.jsx) and [using the ternary operator for conditional rendering](https://github.com/ZanClifton/maximal-murdle-project-page/blob/main/max-murdle/src/components/Profile.jsx)) which probably wouldn't have occurred to me, and I had great fun implementing the ideas! Actually feeling really positive about React at the moment. I think it helped to dial it back and do something simple. Not everything in React is about hooks!

### Day 13: June 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** The content of the Maximal() site is pretty much there, now, but I need to refactor where there is a bit of repetition. [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and I are going to try to figure out how I can fix this tomorrow.   

**Thoughts:** So tired by this evening that I walked away and forgot to update again. Proper thoughts tomorrow.

### Day 12: May 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Navigation? ✅  

**Thoughts:** Okay, I hadn't completely forgotten how navigation works in React, I just needed to talk it through with [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) and [Tomasz](https://github.com/piknik1979). The project page is coming along nicely and I only really need to work out how to display the team photos and bios and it's done. Alright, apart from some styling. I keep coming back to day 6's expanding cards, but it's more challenging in React than in vanilla JS. I think I might set it aside for now and simplify it for the sake of getting it online. And I need to make a note about improving the nav bar on larger screens.

### Day 11: May 30, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Back to thinking about my portfolio and today I've been working on a simple page to display information about Maximal() and our game, Murdle.  

**Thoughts:** I appear to have completely forgotten how navigation works in React. I definitely need to have a think about my approach. Decided to stop rather than carry on while I'm feeling confused.

### Day 10: May 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the Caesar Cipher, which basically transposes letters by a specified number of places through the alphabet and is decoded by transposing them back again by the same number. 

**Thoughts:** I have to confess I was honestly surprised to discover I'd forgotten to update the log when I came to update Day 11. I was tired and irritable yesterday so that may have had something to do with it. I approached a number of the problems differently to the instructor but decided I'd leave them that way instead of changing them to match. I look forward to looking back on these variances in months to come and realising how the way I think about these problems has changed as I've improved. Well, I hope I'll improve in the intervening time.

### Day 9: May 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Hangman! 

**Thoughts:** I didn't get anywhere near as much done as I'd hoped, today. Well, not as much coding as I'd hoped. I did a bunch of non-coding related stuff. It's hard not to be disappointed when I'm not making the progress I want to see, but I need to keep reminding myself I am making progress.

### Day 8: May 27, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Today I did FizzBuzz in Python. I'd never heard of it before a couple of months ago and now it seems to be a staple! I also created a password generator. That was fun! Lastly, I did some of the exercises on [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html) which is a cute little site I'm going to encourage my son to try.

**Thoughts:** No recursion. What a good day! I had a really good chat with [Diana](https://github.com/dianavoz) about error handling on the frontend and how it should link to the backend. It was a real eye-opener! It's made me realise that I need to show Shrelly Mail Online a little more love soon. I'm pretty sure I botched the error handling good.

### Day 7: May 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Two more projects with [100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/), a text adventure called Treasure Island, for want of a better theme, and Rock, Paper, Scissors. Both could probably do with a refactor, but they work. I also started the day looking at recursion to print a certain number of terms from the Fibonacci Sequence and managed to get it working!

**Thoughts:** Why would I start my day that way? I hate recursion. I'm never going to like it. Is it useful? Undeniably! Is it comprehensible? Barely.

### Day 6: May 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Got stuck into some Python basics today with [100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/). The quiz suggested skipping to lesson 15 but I thought it would be worthwhile covering the basics and it turned out to be great fun! Yesterday, I also fixed the active panel issue in the [Expanding Cards](https://github.com/ZanClifton/expanding-cards) project. I really didn't do anything of any substance though, hence the skipped day.

**Thoughts:** I spent most of yesterday lying down as I was so dizzy and breathless. As today's gone on, I've started to feel worse and worse. It's been really slow going when it shouldn't have been. This is a lovely change of pace in terms of learning, though. I've really enjoyed it, and it's making me think it'd be nice to revisit some of the JS basics I've not thought about in a bit (you know, in my long coding career of um... 4 months or so?).

### Day 5: May 23, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Got [Shrelly Mail Online hosted](https://shrellymailonline.netlify.app/), which was a far easier prospect than I realised. I joined in with a Python Boot Camp and was relieved to learn that despite missing some of the sessions I'll be able to catch up just fine. I then took a little while to try [the first](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days/tree/master/expanding-cards) of [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days) but I couldn't get the active panel to display properly.

**Thoughts:** I'm really wiped out and I feel oddly guilty about not doing more. I'm definitely coming down with something. I'm not sure how I feel about coding along in terms of creating repos to look at. I suppose it's okay if I can develop them more and make them into a proper project, somehow. Coding along does seem to be a really good way of learning, though.

### Day 4: May 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress:** I've added some error handling and looked again at mobile styling for Shrelly Mail Online. I'm not entirely certain I've done the error handling right and I'm definitely not confident in terms of testing it. As for the mobile styling, well, you can now view it on a mobile device, which is progress of sorts.

**Thoughts:** I've definitely learned my lesson about mobile first. Just need to get the whole thing hosted now. I may attempt a complete redesign after a little time has passed and I'm less traumatised by the whole process.

### Day 3: May 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** I fixed the issue with deleting comments. I needed the article page to re-render the comments once one was deleted. Without this, the full comments component was disappearing when I pressed the delete button on a comment.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't have fixed that comments issue without having spoken to [Tim](https://github.com/timwtuck) on Friday. Tim was kind enough to explain what was happening with the array at the end of the useEffect hook which I'd clearly never grasped before. It definitely doesn't do what I thought it did! I actually have some hope that it's not impossible for me to get to grips with React, eventually. Next, error handling!

#
### Day 2: May 20, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Added sorting articles by date (which is already the default), number of comments, and number of up votes (or onions, as I like to call them; seems more layered that way). There's also an option to sort by either ascending or descending, too.  I refactored the voting to only be able to give or smash onions when logged in. 

**Thoughts:** I should have considered that a logged in user can mash away at the give or smash onions buttons if they so desire, so I need to make a note to come back to that. I couldn't find a way to make the sorting/order pulldowns look nice at all and ended up taking away my header on the article page. I tried to implement a feature to delete a user's own comments but I can't get it to work. I'm quite frustrated to be leaving things half done today, but on the plus side, at least I know what I'm doing tomorrow.

#
### Day 1: May 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I added the ability to post a new comment to my frontend portfolio project, Shrelly Mail Online. It renders optimistically at the top of the comments section as soon as it's posted and then moves to the bottom once the page is refreshed. The input and the submit button are disabled if no user is logged in. 

**Thoughts:** I'm finding progress on this is slower than I'd like. I feel as if I'm never going to be entirely comfortable with React.
